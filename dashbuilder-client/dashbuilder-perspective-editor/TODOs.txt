Menu widget
-----------
- maven
    - module is in "client" parent module but contains shared resources (still not used on backend side, just client side)
- orientation
- duplicated caption for menu items -> if duplicaten caption -> signatureId is the same! ERROR
- menu group - empty items support
- security
    - Menu item creation/edition - support for adding/removing roles for the item?
    - sending menu model via json in url to the menu screen -> security issue? as roles are in menu model
    - show only perspectives that user have permission
- unit testing for shared classes (MenuHandler)
- CDI strange error
    - MenuHandler 
        - is shared -> no use of client classes inside -> placeManager it's client side and it's not used, so should be
        removed, but if I remove it -> wildfly startup fails with unsatisfied dependencies for AuthorizationManager!!!
        - to reproduce (check no PlaceManager imports in class!):
            
            @ApplicationScoped
            public class MenuHandler {
            
                @Inject
                private AuthorizationManager authzManager;
            
                @Inject
                private User identity;
                
                ....
            }
